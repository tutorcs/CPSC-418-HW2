% p(W, N) -> HowManyCoPrimeIntegersInOneToN
%   W is a worker tree created by red:create.
%   N is a non-negative integer.
%   Count the number of pairs of integers, {A, B}, 1 =< A,B =< N such A and
%   B are co-prime.  Do this in parallel using red:reduce.  In my solution,
%   each process calls red:get(ProcState, index) to find out which worker
%   it is, and uses that to determine which subset of [1,N] x [1,N] it should
%   be testing.

%reduce_bu(ProcState, LeafVal, Combine) -> Total
%  Called by the leaf processes of a worker treee created by red:create.
%    Parameters:
%      ProcState is the leaf process's 'state' (i.e. dictionary)
%      LeafVal is the leaf process's contribution to the total.
%      Combine is the (associative) function for combining values
%    Result:
%      Total is the value obtained by Combine'ing the results from all of
%        the worker processes.  Note that this also provides a barrier:
%        reduce_bu won't return for any worker in the tree until after
%        *all* workers have called reduce_bu.
%    Hints:
%      You're task it to implement reduce_bu.
%      Lucky for you, I implemented red:create to provide some bindings in
%      ProcState that are needed to solve this problem:
%        parent:  The pid of this nodes parent.  If this node is the root
%          of the worker tree, then parent is the atom 'none'.
%        children_bu:  A list of pid's for the roots of subtrees that
%          descend from this process, arranged in bottom-up order.  Consider
%          a tree with 8 processes, P0, ..., P7, and let ProcStatek denote the
%          ProcState for Pk.  Then,
%            red:get(ProcState0, children_bu) -> [P1, P2, P4].
%            red:get(ProcState2, children_bu) -> [P3].
%            red:get(ProcState4, children_bu) -> [P5, P6].
%            red:get(ProcState6, children_bu) -> [P7].
%            red:get(ProcStatek, children_bu) -> [], for k in [1,3,5,7].
%          You could get this by trying (at the Erlang prompt):
%            1> W8 = red:create(8).  % create a worker tree with 8 workers
%            <0.81.0>
%            2> red:retrieve(W8, fun(PS) ->
%                   {{index, red:get(PS, index)},
%                    {pid, self()},
%                    {children_bu, red:get(PS, children_bu)}}
%                 end, false).
%            [[[{{index,0},{pid,<0.81.0>},{children_bu,[<0.84.0>,<0.83.0>,<0.82.0>]}},
%               {{index,1},{pid,<0.84.0>},{children_bu,[]}}],
%              [{{index,2},{pid,<0.83.0>},{children_bu,[<0.87.0>]}},
%               {{index,3},{pid,<0.87.0>},{children_bu,[]}}]],
%             [[{{index,4},{pid,<0.82.0>},{children_bu,[<0.86.0>,<0.85.0>]}},
%               {{index,5},{pid,<0.86.0>},{children_bu,[]}}],
%              [{{index,6},{pid,<0.85.0>},{children_bu,[<0.88.0>]}},
%               {{index,7},{pid,<0.88.0>},{children_bu,[]}}]]]
%          Note that the children of process 0 (i.e. index=0, pid=<0.81.0>) are
%          processes 1 (pid=84), 2 (pid=83), and 4 (pid=82).  You can work out
%          the others.
%      red:reduce that you used in Q1 implements the top-down version of
%      reduce.  If you read and understand that code, that may help you
%      figure out how to implement reduce_bu.
%
%      Your solution should be *much* shorter than this comment.

reduce_bu(ProcState, LeafVal, Combine) ->
  % Hint: my solution just calls a helper:
  %     reduce_bu(Val, Combine, Children_bu, ParentPid).
  %   Of course, you then need to implement reduce_bu/4.
  % Try hw2_tests:reduce_x(4, false) to run a simple test.
